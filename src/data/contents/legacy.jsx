        Legacy hardware, such as old desktop PCs and servers, offers a cost-effective way to build a robust home lab. While modern devices provide high performance, repurposing legacy systems remains an excellent approach for those who want to learn and experiment without a significant financial investment. These systems can be upgraded and optimized to run virtualization platforms, host network services, or serve as dedicated development and testing environments.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg">
        Incorporating legacy hardware into your home lab not only minimizes costs but also provides a hands-on opportunity to understand the fundamentals of computer architecture, system administration, and performance tuning. Even if these systems lack the raw power of new equipment, strategic upgrades such as increasing RAM, swapping in SSDs, or enhancing cooling can significantly extend their usability.
