      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Types of Servers</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>
          <strong>Repurposed Desktop PCs:</strong> Cost-effective options ideal for running virtual machines, hosting small-scale applications, and learning server management. Upgrading these systems with additional RAM and SSD storage can significantly enhance performance.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Dedicated Servers:</strong> Purpose-built machines designed for continuous operation that offer high reliability and performance for more demanding workloads.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Micro Servers:</strong> Compact and energy-efficient solutions that are perfect for lightweight tasks, clustering, or as part of a distributed computing environment.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Blade Servers:</strong> Although typically found in enterprise settings, blade servers provide a high-density and scalable solution for advanced home labs.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Key Considerations</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>
          <strong>Performance:</strong> Evaluate the CPU, memory, and storage based on your planned workloads. High-performance processors and fast storage are essential for running multiple virtual machines or intensive applications.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Scalability:</strong> Ensure that your chosen server hardware can be easily upgraded or expanded as your home lab grows.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Energy Efficiency:</strong> Since home lab servers often run continuously, opt for energy-efficient hardware to minimize long-term power costs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cost:</strong> Balance your performance needs with your budget. Repurposing older hardware can be a cost-effective approach, while dedicated servers and blade servers might require a higher investment.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p className="text-lg">
        A well-planned server setup not only supports your current projects but also provides the foundation for future growth. By carefully selecting and optimizing your servers, you can ensure that your home lab remains both robust and scalable as your technical requirements evolve.
