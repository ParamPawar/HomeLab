          <strong>Efficient Debugging:</strong> Quickly identify and resolve issues by analyzing aggregated log data.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Improved Security:</strong> Detect suspicious activities and potential threats early with real-time log monitoring.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Scalability:</strong> Easily expand your logging infrastructure as your home lab grows.

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Implementing a Robust Logging System</h2>
      <p className="text-lg">
        To set up centralized logging in your home lab, consider using tools such as ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Graylog, or Splunk. These platforms can help you collect, index, and analyze logs from various sources, enabling you to maintain a proactive monitoring strategy.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg">
        Configure your logging tools to filter and prioritize critical events, and integrate alerting mechanisms to notify you of anomalies or security incidents as they occur.
