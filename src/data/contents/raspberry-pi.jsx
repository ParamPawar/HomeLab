            </p>
            <ul className="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-4 text-sm sm:text-base">
              <li className="bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-600 p-4 rounded-lg">
                <strong className="text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">Low Cost:</strong>
                <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mt-1">
                  At $35 for the Pi 4 (4GB) or $60 for the Pi 5 (8GB), the Raspberry Pi is a steal. You can build a fully functional homelab—say, a media server with a 1TB microSD—for under $100, including cables and power supply. Compare that to a $200 used server, and it’s clear why the Pi is a budget king. It’s cheap enough to buy multiples, letting you experiment without financial stress.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li className="bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-600 p-4 rounded-lg">
                <strong className="text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">Compact Size:</strong>
                <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mt-1">
                  Measuring just 3.4 x 2.2 inches, the Pi fits anywhere—your desk, a shelf, or even mounted behind a monitor. This tiny footprint means you can stack several in a small space, like a 3D-printed rack, for clustered projects (e.g., a Kubernetes testbed). It’s ideal for urban homelabs where every inch counts, and its portability makes it easy to move or showcase at a tech meetup.
